<img src="https://celeste.photos/logo_flat.png" alt="Celeste V2 Logo" width="200"/>

# Disclaimer
This is an old version of Celeste. Back from when I was new at web development. I don't suggest using this code exactly, but using it as a way to get started at building your own back-end for an image host. I'm mostly posting this because I don't want to repeat the same mistakes as I did back in the day. Overall this is just a disaster so please use it as a general guide for what to do ONLY IF you have no clue how to implement a feature that we have that you like. Oh and... Remember that some of the code here wasn't written by me but by an ex-developer that I'd rather not name.

# What Is Included?
- All back end features
- DB Implementation
- Emailing features

# What Isn't Included?
- Sensitive data

# Concluding thoughts
Well... with that, I hope that this repo can provide some help to those of you who want to make your own image host back ends.
I really don't suggest using any of the code here because a lot of it includes horrible practices, but you do you.
